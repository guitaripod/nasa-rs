## Technical Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **MVVM-C Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns with coordinators for navigation
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data source details from ViewModels
- **Dependency Injection**: Use container-based DI for testability
- **Protocol-Oriented Design**: Leverage Swift protocols for flexibility

### Third-Party Dependencies (Minimal)
- **GRDB**: SQLite wrapper for offline storage (as specified)
- **No other external dependencies**: Use native UIKit/Foundation for everything else

### Performance Guidelines
- Lazy load images with progressive enhancement
- Implement efficient pagination with prefetching
- Use collection view compositional layouts
- Cache computed values aggressively
- Optimize for 120Hz ProMotion displays
